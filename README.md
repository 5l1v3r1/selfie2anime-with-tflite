We used a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model proposed in this paper [Unsupervised Generative Attentional Networks with Adaptive Layer-Instance Normalization for Image-to-Image Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10830) (also known as **U-GAT-IT**). The paper provides two generators: one that converts a selfies to anime-style image and the other one from anime to selfie. Here we only implemented the Selfie2Anime model since it better resembles the real-world scenario. The GitHub repository of the paper is available [here](https://github.com/taki0112/UGATIT). 

The repository is structured in the following way:

```
|--ml  
|  |--add-meta-data-Colab              // How to add metadata via Colab  
|  |--add-meta-data-CLI               // How to add metadata via command line  
|  |--Selfie2Anime_Model_Conversion  // How to convert and save to TFLite model  
|--android  
|  |--selfie2anime                  // TFLite model on Androi app  
```
